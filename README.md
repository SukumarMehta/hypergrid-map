##hypergird-map

Just playing around with the Hypergird. The build process needs looking at (did this on the train...)

Should be able to

* `git clone https://github.com/datamadic/hypergrid-map.git` 
* in the created hypergrid-map directory 
    * `npm install`  
    * `bower install`
* `grunt serve`

aaaaaand it **should** just run from there. 

###What it does
The [hypergird](https://github.com/openfin/fin-hypergrid) has some [default json behavior](http://openfin.github.io/example-fin-hypergrid-behavior-json/) I just grabbed it and stuck it in angular abstracting out the demo data and sharing it with an instance of [datamaps](http://datamaps.github.io/).

Feel free to ping me or open an issue here if you have any questions.
